<h1> Portfolio Project: Tricky Contest</h1>
Tricky Contest is my end of year project at Holberton School Paris. It's a game developped on Unity. The goal is the win a competition consisting of 3 mini games. But nobody said you had to play it fair, right ?

# About Tricky Contest
This project is a non-profit educational project. I wanted to know how far I could go for a limited period of time for my end of year project as a first year student at Holberton School. This project took my about 6 weeks, from collecting 3D assets to hard coding everything. I would like to work in video games in the near future, so that project really was a good challenge to get to know Unity and C# a bit better, even though I already had some knowledge.

# Technologies
For this project I used Unity and scripted using C#. I used assets found on the Unity Asset Store, Sketchfab, and Mixamo.

# How to play
First, you can visit my [landing page](https://thomasborde94.github.io/Tricky_Contest_LandingPage/) for the project to learn a little bit more about the game, or you can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MrDe6GJdSkfpDDGXmj6BuTT7am9Rw3bQ/view?usp=drive_link). Unzip the files and execute Tricky Contest.exe.
